# Quack
Automatic Ducky Payload Generator

## Introduction

The __Rubber ducky__ is a great suite for penetration testing. However, I tend to find it a hassle to create a payload, and created this project in order to automate that process.


## Dependencies

* A USB Rubber ducky
* Python 2.7.x
* Git

## Download & Installation

Get the repository off of Github by cloning it:

    git clone https://github.com/toxic-ig/Quack

Change into the quack directory:

    cd /path/to/quack

Execute with python:

    python quack.py

The generated payload will be in the same directory as quack.
